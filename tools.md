# Tools overhaul
{: .fs-9 }

---

Every modification you do, from hitboxes and textures to music or sound effects, needs to be compiled (or packed) in order for Jump King to be updated.

Back in the JumpKingPlus days, this would mean relying onto **external tools** on the conversion of those files into XNB, manually or through a script, making the whole process of creating any user generated content <u>take longer</u>.

Now with [**Worldsmith**]({{ site.baseurl }}/tools/worldsmith), this is completely automated meaning you will never have to deal with XNB conversion anymore. That being said if you still want to use those [**external tools**]({{ site.baseurl }}/tools/alternatives), you can still do so even if it's not recommended.

Below the Content packing tools section there are [**Level helping tools**]({{ site.baseurl }}/tools/map-tools); these are quality of life tools that help make level making faster.
