## Why choosing Worldsmith over the other tools?

First and foremost, the whole purpose of Worldsmith is to **aid modders to create, modify and publish their items** with less hassle. 

The Worldsmith's UI is both **complete** for Jump King veterans and **simple** enough for starters, so everyone can use it!

External tools for packing XNB files had to be learned from the ground up before getting used. **Worldsmith deals with  packing your item's files for you**.
