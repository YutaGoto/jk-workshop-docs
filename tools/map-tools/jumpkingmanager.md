{: .disclaimer }
> **Jump King Manager** used to work on the game's memory and it had a tendency to crash the game if teleporting was overused. This issue should be fixed from v2 (Workshop Update).

## Usage

1. Open the game normally, another windows should pop-up in the background called "JumpKingManager", this is what it should look like:
   ![JKM Before]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tools/jumpkingmanager_before.png)
3. Click on a location to teleport in.
   ![JKM on button click]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tools/jumpkingmanager_after_button.png)
   
   > If you need to be **more specific**, you can open the select box and click "*Go*" once chosen a specific screen.
   >
   > ![JKM on dropdown]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tools/jumpkingmanager_after_dropdown.png)
   {: .highlight }
   
   > If you want, you can save the position by click "*Save Position*". If you ever wanted to go back to that point, click "*Load Position*". Or you can enter the **absolute coordinates** directly under "**Level Coordinates**".
   > 
   > ![JKM on dropdown]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tools/jumpkingmanager_after_coordinates.png)
   {: .highlight }

4. Done!
