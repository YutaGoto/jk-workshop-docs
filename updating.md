2. *(Optional)* Write what you've changed.
3. Click **Update**.
4. A prompt will show on screen showing you the progress for your update. Once done updating, Worldsmith will tell you it has updated your item like so:

## Reverting changes

Reverting changes only works on Steam, your project will be unchanged, therefore if you want to continue editing on a rolled back project, you will need to find the changes and undo them yourself!
{: .important }

> For tech-savvies
> 
> Consider using Git (or other version control systems) for each update to ease what's changed.<br>So you can easily rollback on your project too!
{: .note-title }

Sometimes it can happen you've made an unwanted change.<br>
By clicking on the "Change Notes" tab on your item's Workshop page you can check when you have updated your item and by clicking **Revert to this version** (based on the date of the change) you can update your item to the chosen specific version.

![Step 7a]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/updating/Step7a.png)

> This only works if you change the contents of the item, if you change the thumbnail, you won't see any change note.
{: .warning }

> It's recommended to always write what has been changed every update. This way, you can immediately identify each edit and revert back if you need to.
