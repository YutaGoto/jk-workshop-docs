## Three important disclaimers

### Steam's EULA Agreement

Make sure you have accepted [Steam's EULA agreement](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/workshoplegalagreement/){:target="_blank"}, if you haven't accepted it, your item won't be available to be seen by anyone but you and the Workshop administrators.

### Read Nexile's guidelines

<u>Nexile is unlikely to endorse levels that do not follow </u>[Nexile guidelines]({{ site.baseurl }}/getting-started/guidelines/#nexiles-guidelines).

### Playtest your level

Make sure you have read the [**Testing**]({{site.baseurl}}/getting-started/map-first-steps/#testing) section of Level: First steps.

## Publishing your item

Before continuing make sure you've checked the disclaimers above, since they are crucial to publishing your item.

> If your item has already been published, [updating your item follows the same steps]({{ site.baseurl }}/updating/#updating-your-item).
{: .highlight }

1. Open your project on Worldsmith, and navigate to the **Item details** page.

2. Scroll down until you find the **Workshop details** section.

3. *(Optional but welcome)* Customize your item selecting the appropriate tags (hover a tag for more details), a interesting description, visibility and your first changelog.

   ![Details]({{site.baseurl}}/images/level-making/worldsmith_upload_details_2.png)

4. Click on **Upload**.
5. A prompt will show on screen showing you the progress for your upload. Once done uploading, Worldsmith will tell you it has uploaded your item like so:

   ![Update successful]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/level-making/worldsmith_success_upload_item.png)

6. If Worldsmith has shown the pop-up like the example above, you have **successfully uploaded** your item. From here you can either close the pop-up by clicking **Close** or check your newly created item's Steam Workshop page by clicking **Open on Steam...**.

### Add a thumbnail to your item

The thumbnail is what most people see first for your item, having a blank default thumbnail for your item won't make it stand out.

{: .warning }
> For the Steam limitations, we recommend you to follow the following details:
- image type: **png**
- resolution: **256x256 pixels**
- recommended file size: below **34 kB** (kilobytes)
- recommended bit depth: **8 bit**

1. After uploading your item, hover on the image you can find on the right side of the **Item details** page.

   ![Hover]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/level-making/worldsmith_change_thumbnail.png)

2. Click on **Replace**.

3. Find your file through the pop-up, select it and click **Open**.

   ![Select thumbnail]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/level-making/worldsmith_select_thumbnail.png)

4. You've successfully replaced your item's Workshop thumbnail.

   ![Thumbnail success]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/level-making/steam_thumbnail_success.png)

Thumbnail is just the start! From your item's Workshop page, you can add plenty of additional images, videos, links and other stuff!
