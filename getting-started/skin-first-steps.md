## Creating a skin

To create a skin in Worldsmith, you'll need to:

1. Open [**Worldsmith** through Steam](steam://run/2245910).
   > If you do not find it in your library, head over in your Steam library, then on top-left you can find a dropdown and a search box.
   >
   > Either try **searching for "Jump King Worldsmith" in the search box**, or by clicking the dropdown, **select "Tools"** and Worldsmith will now appear in your sidelist like shown.
   >
   > ![Steam search box]({{site.baseurl}}/images/getting-started/worldsmith_steam_search.png){: width="50%" style="vertical-align:top;padding-right:0.5rem;" }![Steam dropdown]({{site.baseurl}}/images/getting-started/worldsmith_steam_dropdown.png){: width="50%" style="vertical-align:top;padding-left:0.5rem;" }
   {: .note }

2. Once opened, make sure you are in the home page of Worldsmith, this is what the page should roughly look like:

   ![Worldsmith home]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tools/worldsmith_home.png)

3. Click on **Create a new project**.
4. Worldsmith will ask you which item you'd want to create, select **Skin set** or **Skin** based on your choice and click **Next**.

   ![Select skin]({{site.baseurl}}/images/getting-started/workshop_select_skin.png)

5. Once clicked Next, Worldsmith will ask you what you want to call your skin (you can change this later) and where do you want to place it in your computer. Under **Name**, click on the input box and **write the name of your skin or skin set**; and under **Folder**, click on the **folder icon** to select which folder to use for your item.
   > Make sure you create a new folder for your skin or make sure the folder is empty before continuing! Worldsmith is **currently in development** and this is a temporary solution.
      {: .warning }
      ![Put name and folder]({{site.baseurl}}/images/getting-started/worldsmith_select_skin_name_directory.png)

6. Click **Create!**, once clicked it Worldsmith will copy and build the default sample skin (or skin set) in the directory chosen.

And that's it! You've successfully created your first skin for Jump King.

## Testing

> Testing your skin is **currently not available** since you can see your skin directly both in Worldsmith and in your pixel-art editor of choice.
