# Screens folder
{: .no_toc }

contains textures such as background, foreground, midground, scrolling images and masks.<!-- more -->
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

All of the layers of a screen can be merged to make a result like the example below (*without counting the hidden wall because that's a type of prop*). Every layer has its own name, format and folder; hover on the image below and click on the image you want to know more about!

{: .disclaimer }

## Background

At the lowest ground there's the background.<br>
The background is commonly used for **skies or gradients** to put on the back end of screens.

### Adding a background

1. Using the **Go to screen...** button or the up-down arrows, move to the screen you want to add a background.
2. Right-click on the preview on the left-side of the page, a context menu like the following should appear.

    ![Context menu]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/level-making/screens/worldsmith_screens_context_menu.png)

3. Navigate into **Add on screen...**, then **Grounds**, then click on **Background**.

    ![Add background]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/level-making/screens/background_add.png)

4. Select your background image and click **Open**.

    ![Select background]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/level-making/screens/background_add_preview.png)

5. After clicking Open, you should be able to see your new background inside Worldsmith!

    ![New background]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/level-making/screens/background_success.png)

### Replacing or removing a background

1. Using the **Go to screen...** button or the up-down arrows, move to the screen you have the background you want to change/get rid of.
3. From the right side of the page, expand the **Grounds** tab.

    ![Replace/delete background]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/level-making/screens/background_replace_delete.png)

From here, you can click **Replace** (the yellow button) to replace an existing background with another one, or click **Delete** (the red button) to delete the background.

### Adding/replacing a background

To add a new or replace an existing background:

1. If you are not using Worldsmith, convert an image file into a packed XNB file with the following details:

    |**resolution**|480x360 pixels|
    |**File name**|bg`SCREEN NUMBER`<br>(e.g. bg65)|

2. Place the new packed file in the `screens/background` folder.
    > If a file is already existing, replace it with the new file.
    {: .highlight }

### Removing a background

To remove an unwanted background:

1. Navigate to the `screens/background` folder.
2. Simply delete the file that you don't want.<br>Following the logic, if you don't want the background of your 5th screen, you will remove `bg65.xnb`.

## Scrolling images
{: #scrolling }

The scrolling texture is commonly used for **mist clouds or birds** flying in the distance [right before the player layer but above the background](#example).

> We are planning to have vertical scrolling images too, so the structure could change in a close future.
{: .new }

### Adding/replacing/removing a scrolling image

Adding, replacing and removing a scrolling image has not been yet implemented inside Worldsmith. If you'd like to do such things, consider looking out the [**Steps (without Worldsmith)**](./#steps-without-worldsmith-1).
{: .disclaimer }

<details class="expander">
   <summary markdown="1">
### Steps (without Worldsmith)
{: .no_toc }
   </summary>
   <div markdown="1">

The scrolling images are managed by an XML file, that determines their texture, position, velocity, layer mode and possible additional frames. In order to have a working scrolling image, you will need to have both the XML file and the packed XNB file.

> If this is the first time hearing about XMLs, [find out what they are and how to use them]({{ site.baseurl }}/getting-started/filetypes).
{: .highlight }

### Adding a scrolling image

If you want to add a new scrolling image:

1. If you are not using Worldsmith, convert an image file into a packed XNB file.
   > While there aren't any restrictions with how it should be named, avoid using spaces or special characters and it's suggested that you name it in a way that you can retroactively know which file is later on.
   > An example could be:
   ```
   `SCREEN`_[NAME]_[NUMBER] (e.g. 65_clouds_1)
   ```
   If you follow such, you can easily tell which screen the scrolling image is used from, what is in the scrolling image, and a number if you have more than one scrolling images.
   {: .note }

2. Head to the following folder: `screens/scrolling`.
3. You can put your new packed scrolling image inside the `textures` folder. Write down your scrolling image file name somewhere, this will be used later.
4. Check if you already have an existing xml file for the screen that you want to add your new scrolling image, you can easily find it by searching "scroll" and then the screen number (e.g. scroll65.xml).
   > **If the file doesn't exists**, don't worry!
   > 1. Copy the following snippet:
    ```xml
        <?xml version="1.0"?>
        <ScrollingBGdata xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
            <scroll_speed>10</scroll_speed>
            <layers>
                <Layer>
                    <texture>YOUR_SCROLLING_IMAGE_NAME_HERE</texture>
                    <position>0</position>
                    <scroll_multiplier>1</scroll_multiplier>
                </Layer>
            </layers>
        </ScrollingBGdata>
    ```
   > 2. Create a new xml file called `scroll[SCREEN]` (e.g. scroll65.xml), open it and paste the snippet above

   > **If the file already exists**:
   > 1. Copy the following snippet:
    ```xml
        <Layer>
            <texture>YOUR_SCROLLING_IMAGE_NAME_HERE</texture>
            <position>0</position>
            <scroll_multiplier>1</scroll_multiplier>
        </Layer>
    ```
    > 2. Inside the `layers` tag, below already existing `Layer`s, paste your snippet.

5. Replace `YOUR_SCROLLING_IMAGE_NAME_HERE` with the filename of your new packed scroll image.

### Replacing a scrolling image

To replace an already existing scrolling image:

1. Convert the new scrolling image into a packed XNB file.
2. Replace the old file with the new file in the `screens/scrolling/textures`.
   > If your packed file isn't named the same as before, you will need to change the `texture` tag in the xml file(s) that previously had the old file or remove the layer completely.
   {: .highlight }

### Removing a scrolling image

To remove a scrolling image:

1. Find the scrolling packed image of your choice and remove it.
2. You will need to remove each  `Layer` tag in the xml file(s) that contained your old file as `texture`.
   
If you want the scrolling image to start in a different X position, change the `position` tag into the X value you want. Same goes for the velocity of the scroll image, if you think it's too fast or too slow, change the `scroll_multiplier` to the value that you want. The higher is the number the faster it will go, and dont' worry, the number works both in positive and negative.

## Midground
Right after the scrolling images, there's the midground.<br>
The midground is usually used for **platforms and details** that are **behind the player** (the player can go over them).

### Adding a midground

1. Using the **Go to screen...** button or the up-down arrows, move to the screen you want to add a midground.
2. Right-click on the preview on the left-side of the page, a context menu like the following should appear.

    ![Context menu]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/level-making/screens/worldsmith_screens_context_menu.png)

   ![List screens]({{site.baseurl}}/images/level-making/particles/weather_screen.png)
2. Navigate to `particles` and open `weather.xml`.
   
   ![Navigate]({{site.baseurl}}/images/level-making/particles/weather_folder.png)
3. Inside this file you should see plenty of pre-existing particles that can be used for your level. Find [**which weather to use**]({{site.baseurl}}/api/particles){: target="_blank"}.
4. Navigate to the `Weather` tag that contains your chosen value.
   
   ![Find]({{site.baseurl}}/images/level-making/particles/weather_find_tag.png)
5. Inside `screens`, add the following snippet and replace `YOUR_HITBOX_SCREEN` with the screen number for each screen you want to have the weather in:
   ```xml
    <int>YOUR_HITBOX_SCREEN</int>
   ```

   ![Done]({{site.baseurl}}/images/level-making/particles/weather_done.png)
6. If you want to modify the velocity, you can tinker with the `fps` value.
   
   ![FPS]({{site.baseurl}}/images/level-making/particles/weather_fps.png)

    > Despite the weather is behind the player by default, the **weather can be on the foreground** by adding the following snippet in the `Weather` tag.
      ```xml
        <foreground>true</foreground>
      ```
    {: .disclaimer }

To remove the weather from one or multiple screens:

> If you wanted to show the weather only in a portion of the screen, continue reading about weather masks.
{: .highlight }

## Mask for weather

The weather, being an effect that repeats on the whole screen, can be rather annoying or obstructing other details on screen, that's there the mask comes in. Masks can be used to give more depth to the level by cutting out the unnecessary particle (for example, inside a building like [shown above](./#example)).

![Mask]({{site.baseurl}}/images/level-making/screens/mask.png)

The mask works just like the difference effect on Photoshop, which lets you **display the particles effect only on the blue/cyan (<input type="color" value="#0094FF"> #0094FF) mask you are creating**.

> The mask only takes effect if a **weather is present on a certain screen**. Check out [__how to add a weather__](./#adding-a-weather) on a screen before continuing.
{: .warning }

### Adding weather mask

1. Using the **Go to screen...** button or the up-down arrows, move to the screen you want to add a weather mask.
2. Right-click on the preview on the left-side of the page, a context menu like the following should appear.
