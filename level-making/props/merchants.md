## How does a merchant work?

The merchant has three main values that gets used for the bargain:
- **the selling item** (the item is selling to you),
- **the currency** (the item used as currency),
- **the price** (the item quantity needed for the trade).

For example, the shroom guy in the Philosopher's Forest wants you to get **9 Shrooms**, this speech ([sale lines](#sale-lines-before-payment)) is usually presented right after the introduction.

![Merchant before]({{site.baseurl}}/images/level-making/props/merchant_before_2.png)

While you haven't collected the wanted amount of shrooms, the merchant will trigger the [not-enough-currency lines](#not-enough-currency-lines).

Once you got all the shrooms, the trading speech ([selling line](#selling-line-during-payment)) will show up.

![Merchant inv before]({{site.baseurl}}/images/level-making/props/merchant_before.png)
![Merchant after]({{site.baseurl}}/images/level-making/props/merchant_after_2.png)

Once finished with the selling line, that's finished you will get the [sold lines](#sold-lines-after-payment) and your item will be automatically worn on you (if the selling item is wearable).

## Retexturing a merchant NPC
{: .no_toc }

To replace a spritesheet of a NPC:

1. Convert a new image into a packed XNB file.
2. Name it as the NPC you want to retexture.
3. Place the file in `props/textures/merchant` and replace the file.
4. If you modified the sprite sheet, you will need to modify the [sprite sheets]({{site.baseurl}}/level-making/props/npcs#sprite-sheet) and the [animation settings]({{site.baseurl}}/level-making/props/npcs#animation-settings) inside your NPC's configuration file (that you can find in `props/textures/old_man/merchant`).
